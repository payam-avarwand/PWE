## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**  
   Run `Persian Wikipedia Editor.py` with Python 3.x.

2. **Configure Pywikibot**  
   On first startup, the app will prompt you to select or create your `user-config.py` file for authentication.

3. **Manage Rules**  
   - Open the "Rule Manager" from the GUI.  
   - Add, edit, or clone normalization rules as needed.  
   - Save changes to automatically update your `rls.json` file.

4. **Process Wikipedia Pages**  
   - Connect to Persian Wikipedia (`fa.wikipedia.org`).  
   - Apply your correction rules to selected articles.  
   - Review, verify, and save the results.

## Logging and Configuration

- **Configuration File**: `config.json` (auto-managed by the app)
- **Rule File**: `rls.json` (user-defined rule set)
- **Temporary Files**: Automatically handled and cleaned up in the system temp directory

All actions, warnings, and status updates are displayed within the GUI and optionally logged for debugging.

## Common Issues

- **Login Errors**: Ensure your `user-config.py` points to the correct Pywikibot directory.
- **Permission Denied**: Run as administrator if file access errors occur.
- **Encoding Issues**: Always save rule and config files in UTF-8 format.
